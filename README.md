# A gallery of object-oriented design

In analogy to [the introductory HTML/CSS/JS screencast](https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro) and [the gallery of basic effects](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/8e881e01245989794c5e) we put together, this repository is a small gallery of basic, object-oriented behaviors and effects.

You can read more about the approach and technical aspects of what's entailed [in _Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter3.html) — 
 and [on Mozilla's Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript).

1. [`raw.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/raw.html) — A raw example of something that's kind of painful without object-orientation.

2. [`class.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/class.html) — The simplest definition of a class, making `raw.html` a little less painful.

3. [`methodsAndAttributes.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/methodsAndAttributes.html) — Adding custom methods ('verbs' your objects can do) and attributes ('nouns' your object has).

4. [`defineProperty.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/defineProperty.html) — Adding custom 'getters' (functions which return an attribute) and 'setters' (functions which set an attribute) using `Object.defineProperty`.

5. [`eventCommunication.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/eventCommunication.html) — Using custom events to communicate between objects.

6. [`subclassing.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/subclassing.html) — Composing and combining classes.

7. [`mvc.html`](https://github.com/dgmde15/Object.Oriented.Gallery/blob/master/mvc.html) — Roughly refactoring our demo to use [the "Model-View-Controller" pattern](http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/)
